.SH NAME

git-branch-data - display most recent commit data for a set of branches.

.\" SYNOPSIS {{{
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fIgit branch-data\fR [\-ahmtuv] [\-b <branchname>]

.\" }}}

.\" DESCRIPTION {{{
.SH DESCRIPTION

git\-branch\-data extends git to make it easy to determine the status of each
of the branches in the remote repository. It prints data for each branch
present on each remote in the form:

    BRANCH_NAME|AUTHOR_NAME|AUTHOR_EMAIL|LAST_COMMIT_DATE|LAST_COMMIT

By default, this information is printed for every branch which has not yet
been merged to the master branch. This allows the user to tell which feature
branches are under active development.

Using the \-\-merged\-only option (see below), it is also possible to get a
list of branches which \fIhave\fR been fully merged to master, and are
therefore safe to delete from the remote.
